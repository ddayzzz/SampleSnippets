# Snippets for variable usage
In order to make it easier for me to use the codes, I have gathered the codes/snippets that were written before. The snippets were written in different programming languages.
## Characteristics
1. They are very short and even initialiy applied to for practice.
2. They are a part of a existed repos.
3. The README file is offered in every sub folders under every specific snippet which contains instructions and environment hint.
4. **Include many own libraries coded in different languages**
