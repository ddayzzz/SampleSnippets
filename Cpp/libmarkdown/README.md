# Simple Markdown parser
Convert Markdown file into html file.
It is a library of [Mooction/MyNotPad](https://github.com/mooction/MyNotePad) and I extract the lib from this project.
# Bugs
1. Infinite loop if use the the `src/md2html` instead of a release of [Mooction/MyNotPad](https://github.com/mooction/MyNotePad)
